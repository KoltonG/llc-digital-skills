# Tips, tricks and suggestions for Instructors

## General Tips

* Blockquotes (text in pink box) contain instructions for in-class exercises or class discussion points.
* Chrome & Atom are used in all examples for consistency. 
  * Students can use any modern browser or editor but let them know that things make look different or have slightly different features.
* Teaching "extras":
  * If you are introducing coding shortcuts (i.e. Emmet), make sure they have a grasp of what the code itself means. Strong foundation *first*.
  * Always provide a non-shortcut example. 
  * Some students may feel overwhelmed with the content already so if that is the case, avoid introducing too many extra workflow/shortcut tips, even if it's supposed to help them work faster.
  * Keep in mind some people prefer to learn one thing at a time.
  * These extras can be an optional exercise if people want to come early or during the Office Hours.
* Exercises
  * anything labeled "Class Exercise" should be completed as a code-along
  * anything labeled as "Exercise" is for independent or (optional) partner work
  * there's no specific time recommendations for the independent exercises
  * start with 10 minutes, then check on the progress of the students and gauge from there
  * encourage them to work in pairs and their mentors
  * review it together after
  
* Homework
  * There are no official homework assignments so encourage students to use exercise time to ask questions and attend drop in sessions.
  * No homework is assigned to make it possible for students to balance work and this course.
  * Encourage them to go through all of the notes and in class exercises or work on a personal project if they want to continue to practice outside of class.
* this program focuses on digital *literacy*, not being a web developer, so it's important to note that distinction
  * students will be introduced to a variety of topics that relate to web development and will be mostly code-based but will still be on an introductory level, though more detailed than the workshops
* Breaks
  * Take a break about halfway through class.
  * 20mins is ideal
  * adding a break onto an exercise would also be preferred (e.g. 10mins for the exercise + 20 min break) but break when the students need it
  
As the weeks progress, depending on the progress of the class you may need to do a small review at the beginning of each class.  If people are asking questions about certain things, do a small review at the beginning of class or ask people if they have questions about previous classes.  You many need to also review things like editor settings, general syntax and best practices.

## Lesson notes
The notes are styled for regular viewing on laptops for students so the font-sizing may be small depending on the projector.  Encourage the students to follow along on their computers.

* may need to zoom in on the notes in the browser, depending on projector size
* click the 'x' to collapse the Table of Contents for more viewing room on the projector
* use the notes as talking points for discussion & questions, avoid reading the notes
* verbally expand on points included in the notes if necessary
  * the benefit of being in class is to have discussion around the topics

The notes are more detailed than the LLC workshops because they are meant for the students to use as a reference & deeper exploration than single workshops but not too detailed to replace in-class instruction and discussion.  The notes also include extra resources for further exploration.

Go at the pace of the learners.  If you don't get through the entire lesson in the time slot, just continue where you left off in the next class.  The last module is light and also includes a "Student suggested lesson" so you can use that time to review or catch up.

##Lesson specific notes
### Module "0"

This is the pre-class lesson and is optional though strongly recommended for students to attend.  Go over computer basics here so students can dive straight into code in the first official lesson.  Some recommended exercises:

* download install software (editor, browser, etc)
* add any preference settings or general how-to tips for using the editor (see notes)
* practice making folders/directories and getting to know where files get downloaded and moving files around
  * e.g. make a root folder for all exercises, then a week 1 folder, week 2, etc.
* practice keyboard shortcuts - use zip file linked in the notes or create your own with the class

Can revisit other shortcuts and tools (emmet, shortcuts, snippets, plugins, etc.) throughout the course if you feel the students are ready.  It might not be worth introducing too many extras if the students are still grasping the fundamentals.  We don't want to overwhelm them and feel like they have to learn so many things.  You can introduce them and those that want to and are capable of exploring can in their own time for during the drop-in hours.

### Module 1
Though the students are just starting to learn HTML, encourage them to try to work on a realistic project (i.e. personal page, hypothetically redoing a restaurant site, something for their employer or business, something for a friend or family member, etc)

Before starting class you can go around the room and ask each person what they are hoping to build.  Reassure them that the project will mostly like change and progress over the weeks but having something "real" to work on will give better context to their projects.

### Module 2
Introduces some design theory but will also incorporate those theories into how to achieve those design principles with CSS.

**Bring some paper & pens/pencils so students can sketch out a wireframe.  Graph paper would be ideal but not required.**
