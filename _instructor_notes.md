# Tips, tricks and suggestions for Instructors

## General Tips

* Blockquotes contain instructions for in-class exercises or class discussion points.
* Chrome & Atom are used in all examples for consistency. 
  * Students can use any modern browser or editor but let them know that things make look different or have slightly different features.
* Teaching "extras":
  * You can introduce coding shortcuts (i.e. Emmet) but make sure they have a grasp of what the code itself means. Strong foundation *first*.
  * Always provide a non-shortcut example. 
  * Some students may feel overwhelmed with the content already so if that is the case, avoid introducing too many extra workflow/shortcut tips, even if it's supposed to help them work faster
  * Keep in mind some people prefer to learn one thing at a time.
  * These extras can be an optional exercise if people want to come early or during the Office Hours.

As the weeks progress, depending on the progress of the class you may need to do a small review at the beginning of each class.  If people are asking questions about certain things, do a small review at the beginning of class or ask people if they have questions about previous classes.  You many need to also review things like editor settings, general syntax and best practices.

## Lesson notes
The notes are styled for regular viewing on laptops for students.

* currently not optimized for projectors
* may need to zoom in on the notes in the browser, depending on projector size
* click the 'x' to collapse the Table of Contents for more viewing room on the projector

Go at the pace of the learners.  If you don't get through the entire lesson in the time slot, just continue where you left off in the next class.

##Lesson specific notes
### Lesson "0"

This is the pre-class lesson and is optional though strongly recommended for students to attend.  Go over computer basics here so students can dive straight into code in the first official lesson.  Some recommended exercises:

* download install software (editor, browser, etc)
* add any preference settings or general how-to tips for using the editor (see notes)
* practice making folders/directories and getting to know where files get downloaded and moving files around
  * e.g. make a root folder for all exercises, then a week 1 folder, week 2, etc.
* practice keyboard shortcuts - use zip file linked in the notes or create your own with the class

Can revisit other shortcuts and tools (emmet, shortcuts, snippets, plugins, etc.) throughout the course if you feel the students are ready.  It might not be worth introducing too many extras if the students are still grasping the fundamentals.  We don't want to overwhelm them and feel like they have to learn so many things.  You can introduce them and those that want to and are capable of exploring can in their own time for during the drop-in hours.
