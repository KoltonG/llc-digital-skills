# Tips, tricks and suggestions for Instructors

## General Tips

* Blockquotes (text in pink box) contain instructions for in-class exercises or class discussion points.
* Chrome & Atom are used in all examples for consistency. 
  * Students can use any modern browser or editor but let them know that things make look different or have slightly different features.
* Teaching "extras":
  * If you are introducing coding shortcuts (i.e. Emmet), make sure they have a grasp of what the code itself means. Strong foundation *first*.
  * Always provide a non-shortcut example. 
  * Some students may feel overwhelmed with the content already so if that is the case, avoid introducing too many extra workflow/shortcut tips, even if it's supposed to help them work faster.
  * Keep in mind some people prefer to learn one thing at a time.
  * These extras can be an optional exercise if people want to come early or during the Office Hours.
* Exercises
  * anything labeled "Class Exercise" should be completed as a code-along
  * anything labeled as "Exercise" is for independent or (optional) partner work
  * there's no specific time recommendations for the independent exercises and may vary
  * trying starting with 10-15 minutes, then check on the progress of the students and gauge from there
  * encourage them to work in pairs and their mentors
  * review it together after
  * exercises sometimes include creating external CSS & JS files so students can practice file management, others include inline CSS & JS file just to reduce the switching between multiple files and also give students practice for using both techniques.
* Homework
  * There are no official homework assignments so encourage students to use exercise time to ask questions and attend drop in sessions.
  * No homework is assigned to make it possible for students to balance work and this course.
  * Encourage them to go through all of the notes and in class exercises or work on a personal project if they want to continue to practice outside of class.
* this program focuses on digital *literacy*, not being a web developer, so it's important to note that distinction
  * students will be introduced to a variety of topics that relate to web development and will be mostly code-based but will still be on an introductory level, though more detailed than the workshops
* Breaks
  * Take a break about halfway through class.
  * 20mins is ideal
  * adding a break onto an exercise would also be preferred (e.g. 10mins for the exercise + 20 min break) but break when the students need it
* Feel free to use your own examples to demonstrate the different concepts (e.g. your favorite websites and tools).
* each lesson is meant to be covered in one class
* if you finish early, you can 
  * start on the next lesson
  * do a Q&A or work on exercises
  * teach some "extras" like shortcuts and emmet
  * if it's only 10mins or so, the students can go home early
* if you cannot complete the lesson in one class, just stop at the regular class time and continue where you left of in the next class
  * the last lesson only goes over FTP info so it's mean to either be a student suggested lesson or some time to catch up or do review
  
As the weeks progress, depending on the progress of the class you may need to do a small review at the beginning of each class.  If people are asking questions about certain things, do a small review at the beginning of class or ask people if they have questions about previous classes.  You many need to also review things like editor settings, general syntax and best practices.

## Lesson notes
The notes are styled for regular viewing on laptops for students so the font-sizing may be small depending on the projector.  Encourage the students to follow along on their computers.

* may need to zoom in on the notes in the browser, depending on projector size
* click the 'x' to collapse the Table of Contents for more viewing room on the projector
* use the notes as talking points for discussion & questions, avoid reading the notes
* verbally expand on points included in the notes if necessary
  * the benefit of being in class is to have discussion around the topics

The notes are more detailed than the LLC workshops because they are meant for the students to use as a reference & deeper exploration than single workshops but not too detailed to replace in-class instruction and discussion.  The notes also include extra resources for further exploration.

Each lesson is meant to be covered in on 2.5 hr class, including breaks. Though you may find some some lessons may take longer or shorter, based on level of the students, amount of questions, some weeks have more complex topics, etc.
If you don't get through the entire lesson in the time slot, just continue where you left off in the next class.  The last lesson is light and also includes a "Student suggested lesson" so you can use that time to review or catch up.

##Lesson specific notes
### Module "0"

This is the pre-class lesson and is optional though strongly recommended for students to attend.  Go over computer basics here so students can dive straight into code in the first official lesson.  Some recommended exercises:

* download install software (editor, browser, etc)
* add any preference settings or general how-to tips for using the editor (see notes)
* practice making folders/directories and getting to know where files get downloaded and moving files around
  * e.g. make a root folder for all exercises, then a week 1 folder, week 2, etc.
* practice keyboard shortcuts - use zip file linked in the notes or create your own with the class

Can revisit other shortcuts and tools (emmet, shortcuts, snippets, plugins, etc.) throughout the course if you feel the students are ready.  It might not be worth introducing too many extras if the students are still grasping the fundamentals.  We don't want to overwhelm them and feel like they have to learn so many things.  You can introduce them and those that want to and are capable of exploring can in their own time for during the drop-in hours.

### Module 1
Though the students are just starting to learn HTML, encourage them to try to work on a realistic project (i.e. personal page, hypothetically redoing a restaurant site, something for their employer or business, something for a friend or family member, etc)

Before starting class you can go around the room and ask each person what they are hoping to build.  Reassure them that the project will mostly like change and progress over the weeks but having something "real" to work on will give better context to their projects.

### Module 2
Introduces some design theory but will also incorporate those theories into how to achieve those design principles with CSS.

**Bring some paper & pens/pencils so students can sketch out a wireframe.  Graph paper would be ideal but not required.**

### Module 3

#### Lesson 2 
Includes a class code-along to solidify the process of creating a web site from creating folders to updating CSS.  Some HTML is provided and a sample project is provided to save time and give direction.  Some students may feel frustrated with the file management (downloading, moving, renaming, etc) but reassure them and remind them that this is part of the process.

The lesson notes has step by step instructions for the code-along. It's a very basic site, not too fancy but should hopefully help solidify the process for the students. You can follow it exactly or just use it as a guide.  Share your completed copy after the lesson so students can use it as a reference.

Remind students to create a Google account to be able to complete the exercises in the next module.

### Module 4

#### Lesson 1

Check at the beginning of the class that people have a Google account to give them time to set up before the lesson starts.

The Google form used in the class exercise links to one form.  Get the class to fill out the form to get some data.  There may already be some data in the responses from previous sessions. Either use the exiting data, clear it or create your own form.

#### Lesson 2
Expect and encourage a more discussion based lesson for SEO.


### Module 5
####Lesson 2 

For the smoothscroll exercise, use the plugin's readme file to get the students used to reading documentation.

If there is time, the bonus exercise is to make the nav fixed so you can add additional plugin options such as the offset. A solutions file is included in the exercise. 

If you still have time at the end of the class, let the students pick what they want to go over from any of the plugin resources listed in the the lesson or one of your choice.

###Module 6
Make sure everyone has a wordpress.com account before class.
