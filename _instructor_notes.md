# Tips & Notes for Instructors

This program focuses on digital *literacy*, not being a web developer, so it's important to note and understand that distinction.

Students will be introduced to a variety of topics that relate to web development and are mostly code-based. They will be taken through the fundamentals but still on an introductory level, though more detailed than the 1 day workshops.

Where possible instructors should aim to demonstrate concepts through code examples in an editor or  code pen. Many have been suggested and provided in the notes but instructors are welcome to add as many code examples as they need to.


## Lesson notes
The notes are styled for regular viewing on laptops for students so the font-sizing is not optimized for projectors.

* Encourage the students to follow along on their computers.
* Zoom in on the notes and text editor when presenting.
* Click the 'x' to collapse the Table of Contents if you need more space to zoom in for the projector.
* Use the notes as talking points rather than reading the notes to the students. DON'T READ THE NOTES TO THE STUDENTS, PLEASE.
* Verbally expand on points included in the notes if necessary, the benefit of being in class is to have discussion around the topics.

The notes are more detailed than the LLC workshops because they are meant for the students to use as a reference & deeper exploration than single workshops but not too detailed to replace in-class instruction and discussion.

Blockquotes (text in pink box) contain instructions for in-class exercises or class discussion points.

Chrome & Atom are used in all examples for consistency.

* Students can use any modern browser or editor
* Let them know that things make look different or have slightly different features.

### Teaching "extras"

* If you are introducing coding shortcuts (i.e. Emmet), make sure they have a grasp of what the generated code itself means. Strong foundation *first*. Fancy tools, *last*.
* Always provide a non-shortcut example.
* Some students may feel overwhelmed with the content already so if that is the case, avoid introducing too many extra workflow/shortcut tips, even if it's supposed to help them work faster.
* Keep in mind some people prefer to learn one thing at a time.
* These extras can be an optional exercise if people want to come early or during the Office Hours.
* Feel free to use your own examples to demonstrate the different concepts (e.g. your favorite websites and tools).

### Exercises

* Anything labeled "Class Exercise" should be completed as a code-along.
* Anything labeled as "Exercise" is for independent or (optional) partner work.
* There's no specific time recommendations for the independent exercises.
  * Try starting with 10-15 minutes, then check on the progress of the students and gauge from there. You want to give them enough time to try out the concepts but if they don't completely finish, it's ok.
* Encourage them to work in pairs and/or their mentors.
* Review it together, as a class, after. Encourage students to contribute their answers and ask questions.

Exercises sometimes include creating external CSS & JS files so students can practice file management, others include inline CSS & JS file just to reduce the switching between multiple files and also give students practice for using both techniques.

### Homework

There are no official homework assignments in this program to allow for those working full-time to balance this program with their work/life commitments. However, there is a recommended video they should be encouraged to watch before you tacke Flexbox since there is not enough time in class to cover the topic in full. The suggested video had great success in the PEI chapter.   

* Encourage students to use exercise time to ask questions and attend drop in sessions.
* Encourage them to go through all of the notes and in class exercises or work on a personal project if they want to continue to practice outside of class.
* Help those who feel discouraged because they may not have had time to start on a project, that it's never too late to start and they should never feel embarrassed about being behind to the point of not attending class. Attending is always better than not! We are all adults in this program and we don't judge students for falling behind. They'll always be welcomed in the class no matter how they're performing.  

### Breaks & Timing

Each lesson is meant to be covered in a 2.5 hr time slot. You may find that some lessons may take longer or shorter, based on the level of the students, amount of questions, some weeks have more complex topics, etc.

* Take a break about halfway through class.
* 20 minute break is ideal.
* Adding a break onto an exercise also works (e.g. 10mins for the exercise + 20 min break).

If you finish a lesson early, you can

* start on the next lesson
* do a Q&A or work on exercises
* teach some "extras" like shortcuts and emmet
* if it's only 10mins or so, the students can go home early

If you cannot finish a lesson in the time slot, just stop at the regular class time and continue where you left of in the next class.

The last lesson is an open lesson with no lecture so it gives you some flexibility. The last lesson is a work period/student-directed lesson.


## Lesson specific notes

### Module "0"

This is the pre-class lesson and is optional though strongly recommended for students to attend.  Go over computer basics here so students can dive straight into code in the first official lesson.  Some recommended exercises:

* download install software (editor, browser, etc)
* add any preference settings or general how-to tips for using the editor (see notes)
* practice making folders/directories and getting to know where files get downloaded and moving files around
  * e.g. make a root folder for all exercises, then a week 1 folder, week 2, etc.
* practice keyboard shortcuts

You can revisit other shortcuts and tools (emmet, shortcuts, snippets, plugins, etc.) throughout the course if you feel the students are ready.  It might not be worth introducing too many extras if the students are still grasping the fundamentals.  We don't want to overwhelm them and feel like they have to learn so many things.  You can introduce them and those that want to can explore in their own time for during the drop-in hours.

### Module 1

This module establishes the foundations of HTML & CSS and cements the students' knowledge in a class code-along project - their first website. It's a very simple page that they will add on to until the end of Module 2. This website is meant to be for fun! Encourage students to be silly if they want to, pick funky colours and fonts, and select a fun subject that they enjoy or are passionate about. There's no wrong choice. In module 3 they will have an opportunity to create their first serious website from design and branding to development.

### Module 2
This module will take students through very important CSS Fundmental concepts like the Box Model, Inline vs Block, as well as some fun treats like Icon fonts, working with images in Pixlr, text shadows and advanced selectors. They will build out a nav for their website and create a social media section with fontawesome icons. They will also become familiarized with spacing and measurements in CSS.

### Module 3 - DESIGN

#### Lesson 1

This lesson covers the foundations of branding, web design and working with grids. Students will complete an exploration that just falls short of a full creative brief to udnerstand the business or client they choose to work with. These can be fictitious or real. Many students will want this to be their own personal business and brand. Remind them that sometimes it's easier to create a brand for someone else's business than for yourself since there is less emotional attachment.

They will create a mood board using Pixlr, a logo and a web design mock up.

**Bring some paper & pens/pencils so students can sketch out a wireframe.  Graph paper would be ideal but not required.**

#### Lesson 2

This is a long personal coding night where the students will have to follow a list of tasks to help them implement their design in code.

It will force students to repeat the skills the learned by buiding our first fun website and go beyond. They will not focus on complex layouts on this day. The goal is to implement their design according to their mood board and sketch using the knowledge they have: html content, css colours, typography, spacing.

### Module 4

#### Lesson 1
This lesson is all about CSS Layouts. They will learn flexbox here and use it to bring to life their own design's more complex layout components. There should be a lot of time in this class after the lecture for mentors to help students with their personal projects and their layouts.

#### Lesson 2
This lesson is about Responsive Design. Encourage the learners to make their website as responsive as they can. Extra time in class can be allocated to questions or independent coding time to build on their projects. If they're still at the branding and design phase, be encouraging and tell them not to give up. Also encourage them to attend office hours.

### Module 5
#### Lesson 1

This is a sweet relief from coding! A whole class dedicated to SEO with some very practical exercises to get them planning for their website content strategy.

Expect and encourage a more discussion based lesson for SEO.




#### Lesson 2

Check at the beginning of the class that people have a Google account.

The Google form used in the class exercise links to one form.  Get the class to fill out the form to get some data.  There may already be some data in the responses from previous sessions. Either use the existing data, clear it or create your own form.

### Module 6
#### Lesson 1

This is an introduction to programming. We begin by easing the tension people feel when we talk about "programming" by getting everyone in the "computational thinking" mindset doing a code-along in the Scratch platform. Yes, it is a platform made for children but Harvard uses it to teach all their Computer Science students so adults don't need to feel embarrassed by it.

Once we are finished with Scratch we will do an overview of JavaScript, anchoring each concept in what we already learned in Scratch.

We finish this lesson connecting our javascript file to our html and testing out that it works with a click event.

#### Lesson 2

In this class we use jQuery to create a mobile hamburger navigation for our website, active and inactive states for our menu items, and if time allows we also learn about how to use jquery libraries to add functionality to our websites. There are code-along examples for smooth scroll, sticky nav and magnific pop up gallery. Instructors are free to show learners how to integrate a different plugin if they prefer such as flexslider.

This is a far deeper use of code than we've done so far. This is the first time that we'll be taking code someone else wrote - a library - and manipulating it for our own needs.

### Module 7
For this section on WordPress themes, students will take their existing website and convert it into a wordpress theme. They will also add a blog to their site if they so choose. They'll have opportunities to continue with advanced bonus topics on plugins, widgets, etc...

This class uses Code Anywhere [codeanywhere.com](https://codeanywhere.com/) (previously Cloud9) to run a local WP installation in the cloud. it's the fastest way to get a custom WP installation up and running. Learners will need to create a free account to access the platform (steps included in the class notes). There are some limitations on the free Code Anywhere accounts - see "Accessing your Site" section of the notes for more information on troubleshooting for this.   

### Module 8
All notes in this module are optional. There is not supposed to be a lecture here but instructors are welcome to review material based on popular demand. If the WP content isn't finished from the previous class, you may finish it at the start of this class. With the remainder, give students lots of time to ask questions of mentors and keep working on their projects.

There are detailed notes on how to put a website live,including how to do it with Github. Mention these resources but don't go over them because most people will not be ready to launch. Students are welcome to attend a coffee and code event or e-mail LLC with questions about hosting when they are ready to go live.
