General Tips

* may need to zoon in depending on projector size. Wanted to style the notes for regular viewing on laptop for students - but not optimized for projectors
* blockquotes contain instructions for small to medium in-class exercises or discussion points
* Chrome & Atom are used in all examples for consistency but let the students know they are free to explore but just note that things make look different or have slightly different features.
* feel free to show students coding shortcuts (i.e. emmet) but make sure they have a grasp of what the code itself means and always provide a non-shortcut example. Some students may been overwhelmed with trying learn extra workflow tips or how to use tools on top of coding (even if it is supposed to help them work faster, keep in mind some people prefer to learn one thing at a time.)


Lesson "0"
- high level demo of Atom shortcuts, etc. Since they won't have any projects yet, there's no point in making snippets yet, etc.  Can revisit throughout the course.
