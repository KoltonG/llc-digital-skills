# Ladies Learning Code Digital Skills Program

These lesson plans are created using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to make use of its templating system for creating mostly text-based lesson plans in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) that are easily converted into HTML.

Each lesson is created as a **[Collection](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/)**.

At the time of this writing, Jekyll supports [Sass](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/assets/) with specific rules.  But doesn't support sourcemaps so I'm using CodeKit to compile the Sass.
