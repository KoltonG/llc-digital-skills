Welcome to Ladies Learning Code's Digital Skills Program!

Below are some tips and tricks to get you up and running and help with your work flow.

<details>

<summary>### Web Browsers & Developer Tools</summary>
<p>
Choose a modern web browser that supports current web standards and integrated developer tools for a better web experience. A couple good ones to use are [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en-CA/chrome/browser/).

All examples going forward will be using Chrome.

All the modern browsers have built-in **Developer tools** that allow you to *inspect* any web page, making it easier to test & debug code. This tool can be accessed in 3 ways:

* Option 1: Inspect
  * **right-click** OR **two-finger tap** OR **control + click** on any webpage
  * select **Inspect**
* Option 2: Browser menu
  * Click the menu <span class="menu-icon">![]({{ site.img }}/module0/menu-icon.png)</span> icon
  * select **More Tools > Developer Tools**
* Option 3: Keyboard shortcut
  * **CTRL + Shift + I** (PC)
  * **CMD + Option + I** (Mac)

> In your browser, open the dev tools and experiment!  
>
> HTML is displayed on the left, CSS on the right. Remember, refreshing the browser will restore the original code, so there's no danger in "breaking" the website.

## Text Editors

* Text editors are used to write and edit code.
* Basic text editors come pre-installed on your computers &mdash; Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Apple) but don't have very many features.
* There are many editors that include useful features such as syntax colour highlighting, preference settings, plug-ins and packages for improving work flow.

Some great options to try out are [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/), [Brackets](http://brackets.io), [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/), and [Atom](https://atom.io/).

In this course and in any examples, [Atom](https://atom.io/) will be referenced.

## Get to know Atom

Having a good text editor and learning how to use it to its full potential will help your work flow.  We'll be using [Atom](http://atom.io) during this program because it has some great integrated features and is totally free!

Here are some features to familiarize yourself with:

### Columns

* adds multiple column views, within the editor to allow for side by side editing
* called "panes" in Atom  
  * `View > Panes > Split Up/Down/Left/Right`


### Preferences
Under **Preferences**, there are many options for customizing your editor.

#### Settings

The Settings include general options for personalizing your editor.

![atom settings]({{ site.img }}/module0/atom-settings.jpg)

A recommended setting is to enable **Soft Wrap** &mdash; to wrap lines that exceed the width of the window.

#### Packages

Packages are tools that can be added to include even more features!

![atom install packages]({{ site.img }}/module0/atom-install-packages.jpg)

[Emmet](http://docs.emmet.io/abbreviations/syntax/) is a great package to install, once you gain some basic understanding of HTML & CSS. This package will help write HTML & CSS faster with some super handy shortcuts!

![atom install emmet]({{ site.img }}/module0/atom-install-emmet.jpg)

Checkout the [Emmet documentation](http://docs.emmet.io/abbreviations/syntax/) and [Emmet cheatsheet](http://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/) to get up and running.

## Folders & directories
Websites at its most basic, are just a bunch of files linked together. Because of this (and just for general organization) it's important to understand folder and files structures.

You will need to create/move/add/edit/delete a lot of folders and files so get in some practice to prepare you for the remainder of this course.


## Keyboard shortcuts

Incorporating keyboard shortcuts will help improve efficiency but can also help to make working on a laptop easier, without the benefit of an external mouse. (Or bring an external mouse!)

View the printable cheatsheet [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/keyboard-shortcuts.pdf) to reference some commonly used shortcuts.

Some other useful general computer tricks:

* right-clicking or a two-finger tap in most apps often reveals more options
* use the space bar & keyboard arrows to scroll

> ## EXERCISE: Workflow practice
>
> Download [this exercise file](exercises/module0/workflow.zip) and unzip it (extract all if you're on a PC). Practice some workflow exercises.  Here are some to try:
>
> 1. Move the folder out of your Downloads folder and put it on your Desktop or your directory of choice.  Working on files in the default downloads folder will make it harder to stay organized.
> 1. Open the entire exercise folder in the text editor.
1. Navigate through the folders and open and close files.
1. Copy and paste content from one file to another.  Try using shortcuts!
1. Open any of the HTML files in your browser (there's no HTML code in it yet, this is just for workflow practice)
1. Add/delete some text, save it and refresh your browser.  Try using shortcuts!
1. Practice switching back and forth between the editor and browser. Try using shortcuts!

Finding a workflow that allows you to be organized and efficient lets you focus on learning to code rather than looking for files!


## Using Slack
Slack can be used in the browser but there are also desktop and mobile apps. Download them [here](https://slack.com/apps).

Some things to explore:

- adding several Slack groups
- enabling/disabling notifications
- joining different rooms and private chats
