#Introduction to SEO

SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is a different story for different kinds of websites!

What kind of website are you looking to drive traffic to?  
What are your goals?  
Why do you want to learn this?  


[Blogger Jon Morrow advises](http://boostblogtraffic.com/make-money-blogging/)...

If you're an independent blogger &mdash; Ignore SEO for the first year.

When your blog is new, the most efficient uses of your time fall into three broad categories:

- Building relationships with influencers (including guest blogging)
- Creating content worth linking to
- Selling your products and services
	
If you do these well, you'll get search traffic without doing anything.

##Introduction to the search game

###Search Engine Marketing

Two components:

1. Paid
- Some call it "SEM": not accurate; (marketing is not just advertising!)
- In the industry, it's called "PPC": pay-per-click ads
1. Free
- SEO: Search Engine Optimization
- a.k.a. Natural/Organic search
- People trust more--can't be bought! Gets more clicks.

##Google search engine
Google has a 65%-80% share of the world's search market.

A Google search results page:

- PPC text ads
- Organic listings
- Google Maps
- Product Listing Ads
- Knowledge panel
- Answer box
- Image results
- Video results
- News results
- Social media results
- Reviews

![]({{ site.img }}/module4/google-results-page.jpg)

Google uses algorithms to determine which results come up at the top.

- Organic: 
	- Desktop, Mobile Phone, Tablet
	- Local search (Google Maps)
	- Other types of results
		- "Hummingbird"
		- Knowledge Graph
- Paid:
	- PPC "auction" rankings
	- Product listing ads


Organic listings click curve:

- The top rankings get the most clicks
- More pronounced on mobile devices

![]({{ site.img }}/module4/click-curve.png)

Position 1: 32.5%  
Position 2: 17.6%  
Position 3: 11.4%  
Position 4: 8.1%  
Position 5: 6.1%  
Position 6: 4.4%  
Position 7: 3.5%  
Position 8: 3.1%  
Position 9: 2.6%  
Position 10: 2.4%

Few users go past page one!

PPC click curve:
Average position = 1: 12.2%  
Average position = 1.5: 4.3%  
Average position = 2: 1.5%  
Average position = 2.5: 0.5%  
Average position = 3: 0.2%  
Average position = 3.5: 0.1%  
Average position = 4: 0.0%  
Average position = 5: 0.0%

So the objective is to get to the top of the pile so you get the clicks!

##What winning the SEARCH GAME looks like

A bit of background:

- Google's objective is to give users the best user experience no matter what words they enter into the search box.
- Anyone can put words on a website, but who is a reliable, authoritative source?
- Google's algorithms sort that out!

There are over 200 factors in Google's organic search algorithm.

- It changes over 500 times a year.
- It's a secret--we know what we know from analysis and knowledge sharing.
- Only 20-25% of the factors relate to "On-page" factors; rest is "Off-page" - i.e. external to your website

###Be aware - there's a "shady" side to SEO!

Black Hat: Cheating by buying a "fake" digital footprint

- Cheap and easy
- Risky: Google is always fighting it
- "Web spam": paid links, dropped domains, free directories, blog comments
- Many agencies offer to rank you for cheap!

White Hat: Doing what's right, not what's easy

- More time, more effort, slower to see results
- Safer: Meeting Google where they're trying to go

	
###You win at Organic Search by maintaining a robust "digital footprint".

- Content optimized to meet user needs when they search
- Links from other, relevant websites
- Regular updates to content
- Engaging social media presence
- Coordination between digital properties

###So you can't look at Search in isolation.

Coordinate with:

- Paid Search strategy
- Local Search strategy
- Social media
- Public relations
- All things digital!
- Dominate the results page!

If possible: align with offline channels as well!

- Ideal: Integrated Marketing Communications

<br>

**Inbound Marketing**:

- Pulling people into your sales flow by fulfilling their needs
- "Earn your way in"
- Demonstrate expertise
	- white papers, blog content, free tools
  
as opposed to **Outbound Marketing**:

- Pushing messages out to people
- "Buy, beg, or bug your way in"

According to HubSpot: especially effective for small businesses that deal with high dollar values, long research cycles and knowledge-based products.

	
##Getting started with search
	
###How do I know if it's worth doing Paid Search ads?

- It's all about ROI (return on investment)! Are you selling a product or service?
- Part of your marketing budget
- Are people searching?

###How do I know if it's worth optimizing for Organic search (SEO)?

- Bare minimum: your site appears in Google unless you block it, so manage what it looks like
	- Set `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` tags
- Put in more effort: you get qualified traffic from your target market


###It all starts with your marketing plan.

- What is your offering?
- Who is your target market?
- What benefits do you provide for them?

Step 1: Understand what and how your target market searches.

####Keywords

- "Clusters" of search queries
e.g. "cell phone"
- cell phone, cell phones, cell phone plans, cell phone stores, cell phone accessories, best cell phone, cell phone reviews, new cell phones, rugged cell phone, cell phone for seniors

How do we find the right keywords to target?

####Google Adwords Keyword Planner (GAKP)
Enter a search term and it shows you:

- How many people search it in the location you specify
- The intensity of competition for PPC ads
- The suggested bid for a paid search ad
	
High volume: 

- More people will see you if you rank

High competition:

- Lots of advertisers! Highly qualified searcher

High suggested bid:

- Valuable conversions to be had from the searcher

Also:

- Google Trends
- Auto-complete suggestions
- Related searches
	- Use these, then check in GAKP

##On-Page SEO - How to optimize a web page for a keyword

The "fundamental unit" in Search is the page. 

- Search engines (generally) return links to web pages as results for queries.
- A page is identified by its URL.
- "Duplicate content issues" - multiple URLs with the same content
	- `<link rel="canonical">` tag

Search engines are supposed to return the best page for a query

"What's the best page about <...>?"

Ideal on-page optimization strategy&mdash;orient your content around a lucrative keyword

As much as Google tries to understand intent (through initiatives like Hummingbird)&mdash;it's still most effective to use exact keywords in your web page content

###Where Google wants to see keywords:

`<title>` - Title tag 

- Title at top of browser (in the tab)
- Link text on Search results
- Title when shared on social media
- Gets cut off after approximately 60 characters
- Presence of keyword is a strong ranking factor

`<meta name="description>` - Meta description tag

- Blurb that appears under a search result
- Also appears when shared on social media
- Goal is to entice the user to click through to your web page
	- This is your chance to pitch your prospect
- Keyword inclusion doesn't help rankings, but bolded keyword drives clickthrough, which helps rankings


####Page content
<div class="example page-content">
  <code>&lt;h1&gt;Header&lt;/h1&gt;</code> - use primary keyword in header
  <p>(body text)</p>
  <p><code>&lt;h2&gt;Subsection #1&lt;/h2&gt;</code> - use related keyword in header</p>
  <p>(body text)</p>
  <p><code>&lt;h2&gt;Subsection #2&lt;/h2&gt;</code></p>
  <p>(body text)</p>
  <code>&lt;h3&gt;Subsection of Subsection #2&lt;/h3&gt;</code>
</div>



###Keyword usage

- No more than 4-5% of the word count
- Word count: Use pages that rank for your keyword as a benchmark
- Blogs: At least 500 words
  - Google tends to prefer in-depth content, discourages "thin" content
  - Enough to fulfill the needs of the audience; be the best answer!

>Exercise: Pick a page from your website and optimize it for a keyword

##Pay-per-click Search ads (PPC)

(Learn this at <http://www.wordstream.com/learn>)

Google AdWords--most popular platform

- Works like an auction

How it works:

- Create an ad group
- Add a keyword to the ad group
- Write a text ad you'd like to appear when someone searches that keyword
- Bid on the keyword--how much you'll be willing to pay for a click
- Google looks at all the advertisers and chooses a set of "winners" to appear on the search results pages, ranked on a combination of factors.

<br>

**Ad Rank = CPC bid x Quality Score**

You pay...

**Your price = Ad Rank of advertiser below you / Your Quality Score + $0.01**

Example:

|---|---|---|---|---|
| Advertiser I | $2.00 max bid | QS = 10 | Ad Rank = 20 | Actual CPC = $1.61 | 
| Advertiser II | $4.00 max bid | QS = 4 | Ad Rank = 16 | Actual CPC = $3.01 | 
| Advertiser III | $6.00 max bid | QS = 2 | Ad Rank = 12 | Actual CPC = $4.01 | 
| Advertiser IV | $8.00 max bid | QS = 1 | Ad Rank = 8 | Actual CPC = highest! | 

Good Quality Score = pay less for the ad AND get the best placement!  
Higher Quality Score = Higher ROI!

###So what IS Quality Score? 

(It's another Google secret!)

Multiple factors:

- Your click-through rate (CTR) - most important factor!
- Relevance of each keyword to its ad group
- Landing page quality and relevance
- The relevance of your ad text
- Your historical AdWords account performance

How do you improve Quality Score?

Consistent work on your account to optimize:

- Keyword research: New, relevant keywords
- Keyword organization: Tight, organized groups tied to individual ad campaigns
- Refining ad text: Test ad copy and use the one(s) with the best CTR
- Optimize landing pages: Provide a cohesive experience from keyword to conversion
- Add negative keywords - Exclude irrelevant search terms that waste budget

Low Quality Scores are primarily the result of disconnect between keywords, ad groups, ad text, and landing page content.

###Good to know...

Match Type

- Broad match: Query includes any word in your key phrase in any order
- Modified broad match: "+" parameter added to word; search query must include that word
- Phrase match: Query must include entire key phrase in order (can have words before and after)
- Exact match: Query must match exactly

Optimize match type to avoid unnecessary spend on irrelevant clicks.

Negative Keywords

- Use keyword research to identify searches that don't apply to your offering
	- Same tactics we used to find relevant searches!
- Build a list of terms to exclude

Eliminate more unnecessary clicks, improve Quality Score, improve ROI!
