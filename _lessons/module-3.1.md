Congratulations! You've come so far in the last 2 weeks! You created your first website, and you've learned how to use so many amazing web tools to create beautiful pages. Now, we're going to create another website, but this time we'll start one step back from when we started before, with an exploration of web design and branding.


## Creating our brand
Before setting out to build a website, you need to have a good understanding of your client's needs. For the next two classes, answer these questions for your own personal website or business, OR for a fictitious business you want to use for fun. Then ask your client (or pretend client) the following questions:

1. What does the business do?
1. Who is their target audience?
1. What is the purpose of the website, OR what do they want visitors to do on the website. e.g. Sign up for a newsletter, donate, request a quote, purchase products, etc...  
1. Who are competitors of the business and what are their websites like? Describe the website's feel and tone.
1. How is your client unique or different from their competitors? In other words, what's their value proposition as a business?
1. Do you think the competitors attract the demographic they want to attract well? Address short comings as opportunities for improvement.
1. What look and field do you think will attract their clients? Describe it using 5 adjectives.

## EXERCISE: Mood Board

1. Based on your answers to the questions above, we will create a mood board. This will help us flesh out our website design.
1. You will use the adjectives, the target demographic and the comparative analysis you did of competitors' websites to inspire your mood board choices.
1. Our mood board will contain a sampling of images, typography and a colour palette to inform our web design choices. Here is the template we will be working from:
<img src="assets/img/module3/moodboard.jpg" alt="moodboard">
1. Go to [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/) and open up the editor that we used for image resizing last week.
1. Select at least 3 photographs from [thestocks.im](http://thestocks.im/) that capture the feel of the brand your designing for. Move them from your downloads into your project folder so you can easily locate them.
1. Next, open up each of those images in Pixlr and crop them to 200px by 200px. Don't replace the original image, but saved a new cropped copy. For example, you could have an image called `roses.jpg` and your cropped version called `roses-cropped.jpg`.
1. In Pixlr, create a new image sized 600px by 800px.
1. Open up each of those images and place them side by side. To do this, head on over to Layer from the main menu and select **Open Image As Layer**. Line them up side by side across the top of the file. Remember to save your progress as you are adding to your mood board.
1. Create a new layer to add your company name over the images.
1. Go to [Adobe Color CC](https://color.adobe.com) and select or create a colour palette to go with your brand. Pro Tip: click on the *Import Image* option in the top left to automate a palette based on one of your photographs!
1. Create one layer per "swatch" (block of colour), and using the shape tool draw squares for each of your colours. Fill them in using your palette colours and the paint can tool. Remember to save your progress as you go along!
1. Create a new layer for your Font Families. Visit [fonts.google.com](http://fonts.google.com) to download more fonts to use.
1. Create a new layer, add the name of your Font(s) and a sample of text written in them.
1. Save your mood board file. We'll come back to it after we create our logo.

## Logos
Logos are an iconic representation of our brand. Creating logos is an artform onto itself.

If we had a lot of time, we could spend days brainstorming with doodles of possible avenues we could take for our logo. We have to make sure to capture what the company is about or the general feel, without copying a logo that already exists. This can be very challenging!
Another challenge may come in if you're not great at drawing.
So today, we're going to pick an icon as our logo from the vast library of The Noun Project or Flaticon. The Noun Project will require you to create an account in order to download graphics, so Flaticon is an alternative that you can use if you do not wish to create an account. We'll then tweak it a bit in Pixlr to make it our own.
>
## EXERCISE: Creating our Logo
>
> 1. Spend 5-10 minutes thinking about what symbolic representations of your business may work as a logo.
1. Go to [nounproject.com](http://nounproject.com) or [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) and choose a symbol that resembles what you're going for. Pick more than one if you want to combine them.
1. Download the icon as a .png and move it into your project folder.
1. Open it up in Pixlr.
1. Change the colour of the icon using the paint can.
1. Go to `Layers > Layers Style > Drop Shadow` to add a shadow. This can be helpful to increase the contrast depending on the background colour or image you're placing the icon on top of.
1. When you are satisfied with your logo, save it as a .png at 400px wide.
1. Add the logo as a layer to your mood board.
1. Now, save the mood board file in your exercise folder as a Pixlr file (.pxd), and as a jpg. The .pxd is your working file, which you can change in the future, since it maintains all its layers. The .jpg is a flattened version that is a smaller file size, but all of the layers will be flattened so it will no longer be editable. Now you'll always have it to reference when designing your website.

## Web Design vs Web development

**Web *design*** and **web *development*** are often thought to be interchangeable, but are actually quite different. Some people do both and some specialize in one or the other.

In a nutshell, web *design* is about creating the visuals. Web *development* turns those visuals into code, to be able to display it in a web browser.

There are even further specializations, such as back-end developers, front-end developers, or interaction designers, user interface designers, or experience designers, just to name a few.

The mood board we created is a small version of what in web development we call a style guide. Check out some great style guides below:

## What is Design?

Design is problem solving. In web design, the problem to be solved is how to effectively communicate the content.

Design uses a combination of type, colour, imagery and form to present content in a clear and concise manner that is visually appealing and reiterates the ideas we want to communicate.


### What Makes Good Design?

1. Clear - the content is easy to read and the graphics and colours support the ideas
1. Concise - content is presented in a concise manner so you can navigate the website to find the content you need easily without getting lost or distracted

> What are some of your favorite websites? Let's look at a few different sites and compare designs.
> Think about some of the social media sites you use often, like Facebook or YouTube. Are their sites designed for you to find the content you need easily, without getting lost or distracted? What do you think their intent is when they designed their sites?


## Purpose and Organizing Content
What do you want your website to do? Who is your target audience? What is the purpose of the website?

When thinking about how to organize and arrange the content on your website, think about how your eyes navigate a web page. Our eyes tend to gravitate to larger elements first, such as:

* large images
* large text
* blocks of color

Then, we narrow in on interesting blocks of content to further explore in detail.

Use the layout of your website to guide the viewerâ€™s eye and provide a clear path for viewers.

## Layout Tips

<div class="summary">

### Size

</div>

<div class="details">

* vary the size of your content areas to guide the viewer
* large content areas can be used to indicate prominent information
* less important information are given smaller areas
* create a visual hierarchy of importance

</div>

<div class="summary">

### Alignment

</div>

<div class="details">

* aligning items relative to each other makes visual connections
* helps users understand the content flow and navigate more easily

</div>

<div class="summary">

### Space

</div>

<div class="details">

* make sure there is enough space around your content
* spacing enhances the readability of your content
* *consistent* spacing adds balance and harmony to your design
* gives content space to breathe, less clutter

</div>


## Designing with a Grid

A popular technique for design layouts is to use a grid. A grid provides:

* consistent structure
* helps to create visual hierarchy
* flexibility in design


<div class="summary">

### Using a Grid

</div>

<div class="details">

Using software like Pixlr or just paper & pencil:

* divide up the width of your page into equal width columns
* include equal space between each column (a gutter), for breathing room
* use the grid to mark areas for the different pieces of content

Though you can use any number of columns, a 12 column grid is common because it can divide easily into 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.  This is handy for responsive designs (can adapt to different screen sizes).

Here's a handy tool for creating a grid: [Grid Calculator](http://gridcalculator.dk/)

Using graph paper can also help layout columns and gutters when doing a hand drawn sketch. Here are some examples: <http://bit.ly/1KbJbfZ>

</div>

<div class="summary">

### Page Layouts with Grids

</div>

<div class="details">

Some content blocks may span multiple columns, others may span only one.

For example, the <a href="/llc-digital-skills-1/assets/img/module2/grid-fs.jpg" target="_blank">Food Sense Blog website</a> uses the 12 column grid to organize the content in different ways.

>## EXERCISE: Sketch a website layout
>1. Using paper and pen/pencil, roughly sketch a 12 column grid on the paper. Use this as a base for the layout for a website. Be sure to refer to the content for your website that you've been working on in the last 2 weeks. You will now explore how you want to layout this content on the page.
1. Next, you can choose to create a more polished design in Pixlr using your knowledge of layers to bring your design to life.
>Block out areas of the page for your content. Experiment with multiple layouts to see which works best. Remember the tips of size, alignment and spacing when arranging your content.
>Pro Tip: If you plan to bring your design to life in Pixlr, <a href="exercises/module3/grid.png" download>download this grid image</a> to layer over your design.

**The CSS techniques for creating page layout styles will be covered in Module 4.**
