#Welcome to Ladies Learning Code's Digital Skills Program!

Below are some tips and tricks to get you up and running and help with your work flow for the remainder of this course and get you ready!

##Keyboard shortcuts

Incorporating keyboard shortcuts will help improve efficiency but can also help to make working on a laptop easier, without the benefit of an external mouse. Here are some recommended commonly used shortcuts to get to know!

* copy, cut & copy, paste
* creating new files and saving files
* switching between open applications
* refreshing the browser

Some other useful general computer tricks:

* right-clicking or a two-finger tap in an application often reveals more options
* use the space bar & keyboard arrows to scroll

##Web Browsers & Developer Tools

Choose a modern web browser that supports current web standards and integrated developer tools for a better web experience. A couple good ones to use are [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en-CA/chrome/browser/).

All the modern browsers have built-in **Developer tools** that allow you to *inspect* any web page, making it easier to test & debug code. In Chrome & Firefox, this tool can be accessed in 3 ways:

**Option 1:**  
On any web page, right-click or two-finger tap anywhere and select **Inspect Element**.  

**Option 2:**  
Click the menu <span class="menu-icon">![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/menu-icon.png)</span> and select **More Tools > Developer Tools** (Chrome) or **Developer > Inspector** (Firefox).

**Option 3:**  
Keyboard shortcut: **CTRL + Shift + I** (PC) or **CMD + Option + I** (Mac).

In this course and in any examples, Chrome will be referenced for consistency.

> In your browser, open the dev tools and experiment!  
> HTML is displayed on the left, CSS on the right. Remember, refreshing the browser will restore the original code, so there's no danger in "breaking" the website.

##Text Editors

* Text editors are used to write and edit code.
* Basic text editors come pre-installed on your computers &mdash; Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Apple) but don't have very many features.
* There are many editors that include useful features such as syntax colour highlighting, preference settings, plug-ins and packages for improving work flow.

Some great options to try out are [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/), [Brackets](http://brackets.io), [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/), and [Atom](https://atom.io/).

In this course and in any examples, Atom will be referenced for consistency.

###Get to know Atom

Having a good text editor and learning how to use it to its full potential will definitely help your work flow.  We'll be using [Atom](http://atom.io) during this program because it has some great integrated features and is totally free!

Here's a couple feature to familiarize yourself with:

####Columns

* called "panes" in Atom  
  * `View > Panes`
* can add multiple columns within the editor to allow for side by side editing

####Find & Replace
* find keywords on a single file  
  * `Find > Find in Buffer`
* find keywords in multiple files in an entire folder  
  * `Find > Find in Project`
* can also find *and* replace  
* more search options found under `Find`

####Preferences
Under **Preferences**, there are many options for customizing your editor.

**Settings**

The Settings include general options for personalizing your editor. 

![atom settings]({{site.imgpath}}/week0/atom-settings.jpg)

A recommended setting is to enable **Soft Wrap** &mdash; to wrap lines that exceed the width of the window.

**Packages**

Add packages under the **Install** tab.

![atom install packages]({{site.imgpath}}/week0/atom-install-packages.jpg)

[Emmet](http://docs.emmet.io/abbreviations/syntax/) is a great package to install, once you gain some basic understanding of HTML & CSS. This package will help write HTML & CSS faster with some super handy shortcuts!

![atom install emmet]({{site.imgpath}}/week0/atom-install-emmet.jpg)

Checkout the [Emmet documentation](http://docs.emmet.io/abbreviations/syntax/) and [Emmet cheatsheet](http://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/) to get up and running.

##Using Slack 
Slack can be used in the browser but there are also desktop and mobile apps. Download them [here](https://slack.com/apps).

Some things to explore:

- adding several Slack groups
- enabling/disabling notifications
- joining different rooms and private chats
