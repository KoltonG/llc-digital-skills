Welcome to Ladies Learning Code's Digital Skills Program! 

Below are some tips and tricks to get you up and running and help with your work flow for the remainder of this course.

##Web Browsers & Developer Tools

Choose a modern web browser that supports current web standards and dev tools for a better web experience.

In [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en-CA/chrome/browser/) (and in other browsers), there are built-in
**Developer tools** that allow you to *inspect* any web page, making it easier to test & debug code. This tools can be accessed in 3 ways:

* Option 1: right-click / two-finger tap on a web page and select **Inspect Element**  
* Option 2: select the menu icon (top right hand corner) and select **Tools > Developer Tools**   
* Option 3: keyboard shortcut: **CTRL + Shift + I** (PC) / **CMD + Option + I** (Mac)

> Open Chrome and try accessing the dev tools.

##Text Editors

Text editors are used to write and edit code.

* Default text editors come pre-installed on your computers -- Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Apple) but are pretty basic.
* Lots of paid and free options that include useful features such as syntax colour highlighting, various preference settings and plug-ins for improving work flow.

Some great options to try out are [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/), [Brackets](http://brackets.io), [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/), and [Atom](https://atom.io/).

##Get to know your editor

Having a good text editor and learning how to use it to its full potential will definitely help your work flow.  We'll be using [Atom](http://atom.io) during this program because it has some great integrated features and is totally free!
