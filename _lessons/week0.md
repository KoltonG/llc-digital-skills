#Welcome to Ladies Learning Code's Digital Skills Program!

Below are some tips and tricks to get you up and running and help with your work flow for the remainder of this course and get you ready!

##Web Browsers & Developer Tools

Choose a modern web browser that supports current web standards and integrated developer tools for a better web experience. A couple good ones to use are [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en-CA/chrome/browser/).

All the modern browsers have built-in **Developer tools** that allow you to *inspect* any web page, making it easier to test & debug code. In Chrome & Firefox, this tool can be accessed in 3 ways:

**Option 1:**  
On any web page, right-click or two-finger tap anywhere and select **Inspect Element**.  

**Option 2:**  
Click the menu <span class="menu-icon">![](../../assets/img/menu-icon.png)</span> and select **More Tools > Developer Tools** (Chrome) or **Developer > Inspector** (Firefox).

**Option 3:**  
Keyboard shortcut: **CTRL + Shift + I** (PC) or **CMD + Option + I** (Mac).

> In Chrome or Firefox, open the dev tools and experiment!  
> HTML is display on the left, CSS on the right. Remember, refreshing the browser will restore the original code, so there's no danger in "breaking" the website.

##Text Editors

* Text editors are used to write and edit code.
* Basic text editors come pre-installed on your computers &mdash; Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Apple) but don't have very many features.
* There are many editors that include useful features such as syntax colour highlighting, preference settings, plug-ins and packages for improving work flow.

Some great options to try out are [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/), [Brackets](http://brackets.io), [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/), and [Atom](https://atom.io/).

Some packages and plugins to note:

* [Emmet](http://emmet.io/download/) (coding shorcuts)
* [Themes](https://atom.io/themes) for Atom


##Get to know your editor

Having a good text editor and learning how to use it to its full potential will definitely help your work flow.  We'll be using [Atom](http://atom.io) during this program because it has some great integrated features and is totally free!
