## HTML & CSS Review

Let's review the concepts and techniques covered in all of the previous lessons by creating a basic one page site, similar to this [example](exercises/module3/sample/index.html), from scratch.  


>## CLASS EXERCISE: Putting it all together!
>
>1. Create a project "root" folder. 
1. Within the project root folder, add a folder for CSS files and for images.
1. Download this [index.html]() file and add it to your project folder.
1. Personalize the HTML
  * Update the `<title>` tag, headings, email and any other content.
  * Add a profile picture.  Make sure images are added to the **image** folder.
1. Add a `<nav>` with two links, "About" and "Contact" and make them link to the corresponding portions of the page.
1. Create a CSS file and link it to **index.html**
1. Update the font typeface for the page using either Google fonts or web safe fonts.
1. Choose and add a different font typeface for the headings.
1. Add a background color to each block on the page: nav, header, about section, footer.
1. Remove default padding & margin from the body element.
1. Adjust the padding for each section so the content/text doesn't go right to the edge of it's container.  Where do you think the space between the sections are coming from?  Try inspecting the element!
1. Float the image in the About section to the left.
1. Add some margin on the right of the floated image.
1. Clear the float!  Which technique should you use?  Check the notes!
1. Create a "content wrapper" around just the content in each section, in the HTML. Then use CSS 'margin' to auto center align the content to ensure that the background color still spans the entire width of the page.
1. Center align the text in the header and footer.
1. Right align the text in the nav.
1. Remove the underline & change the color of the nav links.
1. On mouse hover, change the color of the nav links.
1. Add some space around the links so the text is not too close to each other.  Remember... links are 'inline' elements by default.
