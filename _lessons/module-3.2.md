## Implementing our design in HTML & CSS!

Let's review the concepts and techniques covered in all of the previous lessons by creating the start of our newly designed website, from scratch.

Today everyone gets to work at their own pace with mentor support. You'll be surprised by how far you get in one class in making your dream website a reality! 

>## PROJECT TWO: Putting it all together!
>
>1.  Let's get set up!
	* Open up the "root" project folder where you keep your projects/sites.
	* Within the root folder, create a new folder and name it **project-two**.
	* Create an index.html, styles.css and images folder (css folder optional) inside your project folder.
1. Build the HTML (5 mins)
	* Using your paper sketch or a Pixlr mockup if you got that far last class, build out the HTML elements of your website. Pro tip: Start with the structural elements first: header, nav, section, footer, etc... and then the content inside of each part of the site.
	* If you have more than one page on your website, don't worry about those tonight. Let's just focus on the home page for now. 

1. Update General Styles (15 mins) 
If you've decided to just use your mood board and a rough sketch of the website layout for inspiration, here is a list of tasks you could complete to get your website looking pretty good: 

	* Add a background colour to the following elements on the page if your design calls for it. Rely on your moodboard palette to choose colours :
		* nav
		* header
		* aside
		* social section
		* footer
	* Remove default padding & margin from the body element.
	* Add the border-box snippet to the top of your CSS file!
	* Update the font typeface for the page using either Google fonts or web safe fonts.
	* Choose and add a different font typeface for the headings.
	* Increase the font-size for all h1's.
	* Change the colour and increase the font-size for the h1 in the header.
	* Center align the text in the header, footer and social media section.
	* Change the colour and increase the font-size for the links in the social media section.
	* Add padding around links in the social media section.
	* On mouse hover, change the color of the social media links.
	* Decrease the font-size and italicize of the fine-print in the footer.  
1. Add a wrapper if needed:
	* In HTML, create a “content wrapper” around the content inside the:
		* `<header>`
		* `<main>`
		* `<section class="social">`
		* `<footer>`
	* Use CSS `margin` to auto center align the wrapper to ensure that the background colour still spans the entire width of the page.
	
1. Class Exercise: Adjust the Spacing
	* Adjust the padding so the content/text doesn’t go right to the edge of it’s container.
	
	Where do you think the space between the sections are coming from? Try inspecting the element!
	* In the sidebar, center the profile image using margin, to and make it circular using border-radius.

1. Exercise: Style the Nav
	* Align the text in the nav - is it left, centered, right?
	* Remove the underline & change the colour of the nav links.
	* Using your descendant selectors and pseudo-selectors, on mouse hover, change the colour of the nav links.
	*  Add some space around the links so the text is not too close to each other. Remember… links are ‘inline’ elements by default.

> Your site should be looking decent by now and hopefully resembling your mood board a little bit. There's a lot more we will add to it over the next few classes but this is a great start. For the remainder of the class, continue adding styles and be sure to use the inspect tools in the browser to adjust different styles based on how they look. You're the boss on this one! 

Have fun! 

> ## RECOMMENDED HOMEWORK: Flexbox Video Tutorial
> Next week we'll be tackling the power of CSS Layouts. One of the properties of CSS we'll spend time on is Flexbox. Flexbox is a bit tricky to understand right away so we recommend that you watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7EIAgfkhmg&feature=youtu.be) before next class to be extra prepared. It's really funny too!
