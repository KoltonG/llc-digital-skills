        <h1>Design</h1>
        <p>Congratulations! You’ve come so far in the last 2 weeks. You created your first website, for starters! Plus you can now use so many new amazing web tools to create beautiful things. Now we’re going to create another website, but this time we’ll start one step back from when we started before. We’ll start with an exploration of web design and branding.</p>

<h2 id="creating-our-brand">Creating our brand</h2>
<p>Before setting out to build a website, you need to have a good understanding of your client’s needs. For the next two classes, answer these questions for your own personal website or business, OR for a fictitious business you want to use for fun. Then ask your client (or pretend client) the following questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What does the business do?</li>
  <li>Who is their target audience?</li>
  <li>What is the purpose of the website, OR what do they want visitors to do on the website. e.g. Sign up for a newsletter, donate, request a quote, purchase products, etc…</li>
  <li>Who are competitors of the business and what are their websites like? Describe the website’s feel and tone.</li>
  <li>How is your client unique or different than the competitors? In other words, what’s their value proposition as a business?</li>
  <li>Do you think the competitors attract the demographic they want to attract well? How so?</li>
  <li>What look and field do you think will attract their clients? Describe it with 5 adjectives.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="exercise-mood-board">EXERCISE: Mood Board</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Based on your answers to the questions above, we will create a Mood Board. This will help us flesh out our website design.</li>
  <li>You will use the adjectives, the target demographic and the comparative analysis you did of competitors’ websites to inspire your mood board choices.</li>
  <li>Our mood board will contain a sampling of images, typography and a colour palette to inform our web design choices later on. 
<img src="assets/img/module3/moodboard.jpg" alt="moodboard" /></li>
  <li>Go to pixlr and open up the editor that we used for image resizing last week.</li>
  <li>You will create a new “image” sized 600px by 800px.</li>
  <li>Now that you have a blank page you will start by selecting at least 3 photographs from thestocks.im that capture the feel of the brand your designing for. 1. Next, open up each of those images and crop them so that they are square and no larger than 200px by 200px.</li>
  <li>Back in your blank moodboard pixlr project you will open up each of those images and place them side by side. To do this, head on over to Layer from the main menu and select <strong>Open Image As Layer</strong>. Line them up side by side at the top of the file.</li>
  <li>Create a new layer to add your company name over the images.</li>
  <li>Go to adobe.color.com and select or create a colour palette to go with your brand. Pro Tip: click on the camera icon to automate a palette from one of your photographs!</li>
  <li>Create one layer per swatch and using the shape drawer, draw squares for each of your colours. Fill them in using your palette colours and the pain can.</li>
  <li>Create a new layer for your Font Families. Visit <a href="http://fonts.google.com">fonts.google.com</a> if you’re not sure what to choose.</li>
  <li>In the new layer, add the name of your fonts and a sample of text written in them. Google fonts should automatically load on Pixlr.</li>
  <li>Save your moodboard file. We’ll come back to it after we create our logo.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="logos">Logos</h2>
<p>Logos are an iconic representation of our brand. Creating logos can be an artform onto themselves.</p>

<p>If we had a lot of time we could spend hours brainstorming with doodles of possible avenues we could take for our logo. We have to make sure to capture what the company is about or the general feel, without copying a logo that already exists. This can be very challening! 
Another challenge may come in if you’re not great at drawing. 
So today, we’re going to pick an icon as our logo from the vast library of The Noun Project. And we’ll tweak it a bit in Pixlr to make it our own.</p>
<blockquote>

  <h2 id="exercise-creating-our-logo">EXERCISE: Creating our Logo</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Spend 5-10 minutes thinking about what symbolic representations of your business may work as a logo.</li>
    <li>Go to <a href="http://nounproject.com">nounproject.com</a> and choose a symbol that resembles what you’re going for. Pick more than one if you want to combine them.</li>
    <li>Download the icon and open it up in Pixlr.</li>
    <li>Play around with colouring it if you want using the paint can.</li>
    <li>Go to Layers&gt;Layers Style&gt;Drop Shadow for a cool effect.</li>
    <li>When you are satisfied with your logo, save it as a png. Make sure it’s sized properly and not huge. 200px wide, max.</li>
    <li>Add the logo as a layer to your Moodboard.</li>
    <li>Now, save the moodboard file in your exercise folde as a pixlr file and as a jpg. Then,  you’ll always have it to reference when designing your website.</li>
  </ol>

<h2 id="web-design-vs-web-development">Web Design vs Web development</h2>

<p><strong>Web <em>design</em></strong> and <strong>web <em>development</em></strong> are often thought to be interchangeable but are actually quite different. Some people do both and some specialize in one or the other.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, web <em>design</em> is about creating the visuals. Web <em>development</em> turns those visuals into code, to be able to display it in a web browser.</p>

<p>There are even further specializations, such as back-end developers, front-end developers and interaction designers, just to name a few.</p>

<p>The moodboard we created is a small version of what in web development we call a styleguide. Check out some great style guides below:</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-design">What is Design?</h2>

<p>Design is problem solving. In web design, the problem to be solved is how to effectively communicate the content.</p>

<p>Design uses a combination of type, color, images and form to present content in a clear and concise manner that is visually appealing and reiterates the ideas we want to communicate.</p>

<h3 id="what-makes-good-design">What Makes Good Design?</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Clear - the content is easy to read and the graphics and colors support the ideas</li>
  <li>Concise - content is presented in a concise manner and you can navigate the website to find the content you need easily</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are some of your favorite websites? Let’s look at a few different sites and compare designs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="purpose-and-organizing-content">Purpose and Organizing Content</h2>
<p>What do you want your website to do? Who is your target audience? What is the purpose of the website?</p>

<p>When thinking about how to organize and arrange the content on your website, think about how your eyes navigate a web page. Our eyes tend to gravitate to larger elements first, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>large images</li>
  <li>large text</li>
  <li>blocks of color</li>
</ul>

<p>Then we narrow in on interesting blocks of content to further explore in detail.</p>

<p>Use the layout of your website to guide the viewer’s eye and provide a clear path for viewers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Based on purpose and organization, how would a photographers website differ from a news outlet?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="layout-tips">Layout Tips</h2>

<h3 id="size">Size</h3>

<ul>
  <li>vary the size of your content areas to guide the viewer</li>
  <li>large content areas can be used to indicate prominent information</li>
  <li>less important information are given smaller areas</li>
  <li>create a visual hierarchy of importance</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="alignment">Alignment</h3>

<ul>
  <li>aligning items relative to each other makes visual connections</li>
  <li>helps users understand the content flow and navigate more easily</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="space">Space</h3>

<ul>
  <li>make sure there is enough space around your content</li>
  <li>spacing enhances the readability of your content</li>
  <li><em>consistent</em> spacing adds balance and harmony to your design</li>
  <li>gives content space to breathe, less clutter</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="designing-with-a-grid">Designing with a Grid</h2>

<p>A popular technique for design layouts is to use a grid. A grid provides:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consistent structure</li>
  <li>helps to create visual hierarchy</li>
  <li>flexibility in design</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="using-a-grid">Using a Grid</h3>

<p>Using software like Pixlr or just paper &amp; pencil:</p>

<ul>
  <li>divide up the width of your page into equal width columns</li>
  <li>include equal space between each column (a gutter), for breathing room</li>
  <li>use the grid to mark areas for the different pieces of content</li>
</ul>

<p>Though you can use any number of columns, a 12 column grid is common because it can divide easily into 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.  This is handy for responsive designs (can adapt to different screen sizes).</p>

<p>Here’s a handy tool for creating a grid: <a href="http://gridcalculator.dk/">Grid Calculator</a></p>

<p>Using graph paper can also help layout columns and gutters when doing a hand drawn sketch. Here are some examples: <a href="http://bit.ly/1KbJbfZ">http://bit.ly/1KbJbfZ</a></p>

<h3 id="page-layouts-with-grids">Page Layouts with Grids</h3>

<p>Some content blocks may span multiple columns, others may span only one. Not every page component needs to fit into the grid dimensions either.</p>

<p>For example, the <a href="assets/img/module2/grid-fs.jpg">Food Sense Blog website</a> uses the 12 column grid to organize the content in different ways.</p>

<p>In this article, <a href="https://designschool.canva.com/blog/grid-design/">15 Reasons Why A Grid Based Approach Will Improve Your Designs</a>, you can see even more ways to lay out content with a wide variety of grids.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2 id="exercise-sketch-a-website-layout">EXERCISE: Sketch a website layout</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Using paper and pen/pencil, roughly sketch a 12 column grid on the paper. Use this as a base for the layout for a website. Be sure to refer to the content for your website that you worked on in our first class. You will now explore what you want this content to look like on the page.s</li>
    <li>Next, you can choose to create a more polished design in Pixlr using your knowledge of layers, to bring your design to life. Or, you can design the website in the browser using inspect tools and your mood board as you go along coding your site. It’s up to you! If you’re going to use Pixlr, you can start now. 
Block out areas of the page for your content. Experiment with multiple layouts. Remember the tips of size, alignment and spacing when arranging your content.
Pro Tip: If you plan to bring your design to life in Pixlr download this <a href="exercises/module3/grid.jpg" download="">grid image to layer your design over inside of Pixlr.</a></li>
