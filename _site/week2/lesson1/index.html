        <h2 id="brainstorming-questions">Brainstorming questions</h2>

<p>Here are some questions that can help you (or your clients) define your brand &amp; goals for your website and business.  You don’t have to have an answer for all of these questions but keeping these ideas in mind before starting the design process can help inform you decisions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Describe your business/service in a couple of sentences.</li>
  <li>What is the vision/mission for your business or the values that represent your business?</li>
  <li>Do you have/want a tagline or slogan? If so, what is it?</li>
  <li>Where and how will your logo be used? This may change and expand but for the foreseeable future. (ie. website, business cards, posters, stationary, packaging, tshirts, etc.)</li>
  <li>What should people think or feel when they see your brand?</li>
  <li>Use 5 adjectives to describe your brand’s personality.</li>
  <li>What makes a design or brand good, in your opinion?</li>
  <li>Do you prefer typographic logos or ones with imagery?</li>
  <li>If your brand were a city, which city would it be and why?</li>
  <li>Please select one from each pair:
    <ul>
      <li>Sans serif / Serif</li>
      <li>Cursive / Printed</li>
      <li>Soft / Bold</li>
      <li>Minimal / Ornate</li>
      <li>Bright / Muted</li>
      <li>Vintage / Modern</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-design">What is Design?</h2>

<p>Design is problem solving.</p>

<p>In web design, the problem we’re trying to solve is how to effectively communicate our content. Design uses a combination of type, color, images and form to present content in a clear and concise manner that is visually appealing and reiterates the ideas we want to communicate.</p>

<h3 id="what-makes-good-design">What makes good design?</h3>
<p>Good web design is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Clear - the content is easy to read and the graphics and colors support the ideas</li>
  <li>Concise - content is presented in a concise manner and you can navigate the website to find the content you need easily</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://brianhogg.com/">Brian Hogg</a> - simplicity provides clarity.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.lottanieminen.com/">Lotta Nieminen</a> - sophisticated page transitions aside, the content is easy to find and navigate.</li>
  <li><a href="http://jasonsantamaria.com/">Jason Santa Maria</a> - type and alignment is used to organize content.</li>
  <li><a href="http://foodsense.is/">Food Sense Blog</a> - content is organized in a visual hierarcy.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="purpose-and-content">Purpose and Content</h2>
<p>The content you present on your website depends on the goals of your website and/or business. What do you want your website to do? Who is your target audience?</p>

<p>For example, a photographer has a different goal than a news outlet. A photographer may want to showcase their work on their website, so their content will be primarily made up of images. A news outlet has the goal of communicating up-to-date news articles, so their content will be primarily made up of journalistic text.</p>

<p>Understanding your goals is the first step to designing a website. Once you understand what you want to communicate with your website, you can start to plan and design your content.</p>

<h2 id="organizing-content">Organizing Content</h2>
<p>Designing on the web involves organizing and arranging the content on your website.</p>

<p>Think about how our eyes navigate a web page. They are constantly scanning information in order to understand the content even before we begin to read.</p>

<p>Our eyes tend to gravitate to the larger elements on the page first: large images, large text or blocks of color. Then we narrow in on interesting block of content and look further to explore in detail.</p>

<p>Use the layout of your website to guide the viewer’s eye and provide a clear path for viewers to navigate our website.</p>

<h2 id="layout-tips">Layout Tips</h2>

<h3 id="size">Size</h3>
<p>Vary the size of your content areas to guide the viewer. Large content areas are a good indicator of prominent information, while less important information are given smaller areas. This technique gives the content a hierarchy of importance.</p>

<h3 id="alignment">Alignment</h3>
<p>When arranging items on your page, consider what other elements need to be there. Aligning items relative to each other allows the viewer to make visual connections so they understand the content and navigate the page more easily.</p>

<h3 id="space">Space</h3>
<p>Ensuring enough space around your content is important for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>readability - spacing enhances the readability of your content</li>
  <li>balance - <em>consistent</em> spacing adds balance and harmony to your design</li>
  <li>clarity - give your content space to breathe, a cluttered website is overwhelming to the user</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="designing-with-a-grid">Designing with a Grid</h2>
<p>A grid provides:</p>

<ul>
  <li>structure</li>
  <li>clarity</li>
  <li>flexibility</li>
</ul>

<p>To use a grid, divide up the width of your page into equal width columns, with equal space between each one for breathing room (this is called a gutter).</p>

<p>The most common grid structure is a 12 column grid because it can divide easily into 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 areas for the different pieces of content. Divide the width of your page into 12 columns with gutters. Then lay out your content within the grid, marking areas for the different pieces of content you need. Some pieces of content may span multiple columns, others may span only one.</p>

<h4 id="examples-1">Examples</h4>

<p><a href="/llc-digital-skills/assets/img/week2/01-grid-bg.jpg">Brian’s website</a> uses a 10 column grid for his main content with a 1 column padding on either side.</p>

<p><a href="/llc-digital-skills/assets/img/week2/04-grid-lna.jpg">Lotta’s website</a> uses a 3 column grid for her portfolio page. Notice that her <a href="/llc-digital-skills/assets/img/week2/04-grid-ln.jpg">About</a> page content is divided into a 4 column grid.</p>

<p><a href="/llc-digital-skills/assets/img/week2/03-grid-jsm.jpg">Jason’s website</a> uses a 11 column grid for his main content ( some of which is divided further) with a designated left column dates.</p>

<p>The <a href="/llc-digital-skills/assets/img/week2/02-grid-fs.jpg">Food Sense Blog website</a> uses the 12 column grid to organize their content in different ways. A 2 column wide area on the left is designated for the logo and navigation. While the main content is divided into 1 large area as well as 4 smaller columns.</p>

  <h2 id="exercise-lay-out-your-website">EXERCISE: Lay Out Your Website</h2>
  <p>Using a paper and pen/pencil, roughly sketch a 12 column grid on the paper. Use this as a base for the layout of for your website.</p>

  <p>Block out areas of the page for your content. Experiment with multiple layouts. Remember the tips of size, alignment and spacing when arranging your content.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="working-with-images">Working with Images</h2>

<h3 id="raster-bitmap--vs-vector-images">Raster (Bitmap)  vs. Vector Images</h3>

<p><strong>Raster images</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>made up of pixels arranged in a grid</li>
  <li>resolution dependent, therefore is not scalable</li>
  <li>used for complex images with rich detail, like photos</li>
  <li>saved in .jpg, .gif, .png formats</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Vector images</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>made up of points, lines and shapes that are combined using a mathematical formula</li>
  <li>resolution independent, therefore is scalable</li>
  <li>used for 2D graphics like logos and icons</li>
  <li>saved in .svg (stands for Scalable Vector Graphics) format</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cropping-and-saving-images">Cropping and Saving Images</h3>
<p>When working with (raster) images and photos resize or crop the image to the largest size you need.</p>

<p>Save your images in one of the following compressed file formats to keep file size low:</p>

<ul>
  <li>.jpg - for photographs with rich detail</li>
  <li>.png - for images with transparent or opaque backgrounds</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="image-editors">Image editors</h3>
<p>You will need an image editor tool to crop and edit your images. <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html">Adobe Photoshop</a> and <a href="http://www.sketchapp.com/">Sketch</a> are popular options but <a href="https://pixlr.com/editor/">Pixlr</a> is also a great free alternative.</p>

<p><img src="/llc-digital-skills/assets/img/week2/05-pxlr-crop.jpg" class="left" /> In <strong>Pixlr</strong> (and in most image editors), use the crop tool in the toolbar to crop your images.</p>

<p>Then, go to <strong>Image → Image Size…</strong> to resize your images. Make sure “Constrain Proportions” is checked to maintain proper image proportions.</p>

  <h2 id="exercise-resizing-images">EXERCISE: Resizing Images</h2>
  <p>Using <a href="https://pixlr.com/editor/">Pixlr</a>, practice cropping and resizing images. Use your own images, or choose from a number of placeholder sites or stock photography sites listed in the below resource links.</p>

  <p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Check out some of the other menu options to familiarize yourself with the tool.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="typography">Typography</h2>
<p>The role of type is to communicate your message to the reader. Good writing and good typography can help your reader understand your message more clearly. Bad writing and bad typography can do the opposite–confuse your reader.</p>

<h3 id="terminology">Terminology</h3>
<p><strong>Typography</strong> is the art of arranging type to engage and guide your readers.<br />
<strong>Typeface</strong> is what you think of when you think of Font. It is a set of fonts or a font family that is designed with common characteristics and features.<br />
<strong>Font</strong> is the individual font file that is part of the font family or typeface.</p>

<p>For example, <em>Helvetica Neue</em> is the <strong>typeface</strong>. It is a font family which contains many <strong>font</strong> files from <em>Helvetica Neue Ultra Light</em> to <em>Helvetica Neue Extra Bold</em>. The decision to set your type in <em>Helvetica Neue</em> and how you arrange it on the page is <strong>typography</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="type-classification">Type Classification</h3>
<p>Before we talk about how to select the right font for your project, we need to understand how to talk about typefaces. There are thousands of typefaces. To make sense of it all we can categorize them to the broad categories below. (Each category can be broken down further but these categories give you a general idea of how to distinguish and identify typefaces.)</p>

<p><img class="left type print-15" src="/llc-digital-skills/assets/img/week2/07-serif.jpg" /></p>

<h3 id="serif">Serif</h3>
<p>Serif typefaces are distinguished by the little feet or hats at the bottom or top of the letters.</p>

<p>These typefaces grew out of the handlettering of scribes and roman or blackletter calligraphic writing.</p>

<hr class="clear" />

<p><img class="left type print-15" src="/llc-digital-skills/assets/img/week2/08-sansserif.jpg" /></p>

<h3 id="sans-serif">Sans Serif</h3>
<p>Sans serif typefaces have–just like the name implies–no serifs at the end of the strokes.</p>

<p>Most sans serif typefaces are monoweight, meaning the strokes of the letterform appears to be all one weight.</p>

<hr class="clear" />

<blockquote class="note">
  <p>Much debate has gone into whether serif typefaces are better than sans serif typefaces in terms of readability at different sizes. Some argue that serif typefaces have historically been better for small text because their serifs guide the eye while reading. Others assert that sans serif typefaces are better for reading because they are unencumbered by serifs. Classification aside, when selecting a font, consider the application and the readability of the letterforms at the sizes you need.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img class="left type print-15" src="/llc-digital-skills/assets/img/week2/09-script.jpg" /></p>

<h3 id="script">Script</h3>

<p>Script typefaces appear as if handlettered with a calligraphy pen, brush or pencil or pen. Use script typefaces sparingly and appropriately for your content. Script typefaces can prove to be unreadable in small sizes, all caps and in long blocks of text.</p>

<hr class="clear" />

<p><img class="left type print-15 decorative" src="/llc-digital-skills/assets/img/week2/10-display.jpg" /></p>

<h3 id="decorative">Decorative</h3>
<p>Decorative typefaces have the characteristic of being very distinct in their style. While not great for long blocks of text where their decorative style becomes all too consuming and unreadable, they can be great for decorative touches and add character to a design. Most decorative typefaces are one offs containing just one font file.</p>

<hr class="clear" />

<h3 id="designing-with-type">Designing with Type</h3>
<p>When designing with type, consider the following:</p>

<h4 id="personality-and-tone">Personality and Tone</h4>
<p>Think about what you want to say with your copy, tone of voice and the personality that you want your website to have. Is it casual or formal? Is it lighthearted or serious? Good typography reinforces the meaning of your text.</p>

<h4 id="readability-and-accessibility">Readability and Accessibility</h4>
<p>Type should be easy and comfortable to read. Select fonts, size and color that allows your type to be easy to read for a your target audience.</p>

<h4 id="harmony-and-rhythm">Harmony and Rhythm</h4>
<p>Consider all the pieces of content that your website needs to display. Each piece of content has a role to play. Use size, style, color and spacing to create a typographic hierarchy. Defining a consistent style for each type of content adds harmony, rhythm and clarity to your design.</p>

<h4 id="brevity">Brevity</h4>
<p>Keep your content as concise as possible. Most people tend to scan content and will skip large text content.</p>

<h3 id="tips-for-selecting-and-pairing-fonts">Tips for Selecting and Pairing Fonts</h3>

<h4 id="personality">Personality</h4>
<p>Select fonts to reflect your personality, tone of voice and/or your brand. Your content has a certain tone and personality that represents you, your company, your brand and/or product.</p>

<h4 id="readability">Readability</h4>
<p>Choose fonts that are easy to read. Try them in various sizes, weights and styles.</p>

<h4 id="contrast">Contrast</h4>
<p>When pairing fonts, strive for sufficient contrast by choosing typefaces of different types or styles, such as a serif and a sans serif, or a thick condensed sans-serif with a thin sans-serif.</p>

<h4 id="flexibility">Flexibility</h4>
<p>Your type needs to do a lot of work. Select fonts that have multiple styles to give you the most flexibility.</p>

<h4 id="clarity">Clarity</h4>
<p>Select only one or two typefaces for your content. Too many typefaces makes your design unclear and confusing.</p>

<h4 id="completeness">Completeness</h4>
<p>Look for fonts that have a complete character set. Pay attention to the glyphs and special characters you might need such as “@”, “$”, “#”, etc. Missing characters is a sign of an incomplete and poorly designed font.</p>

<h4 id="resource">Resource</h4>
<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/whatfont/jabopobgcpjmedljpbcaablpmlmfcogm">Chrome extension</a> for finding out what fonts are used on any website.</p>

<h2 id="free-vs-premium-fonts">Free vs. Premium Fonts</h2>

<p>There are thousands of fonts available. They can range in price from top quality high end fonts to free fonts.</p>

<p>Free fonts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>free, so no cost to use (sometimes free for personal use but need to be paid for commercial use)</li>
  <li>hard to find good quality free fonts</li>
  <li>may have missing characters</li>
  <li>limited in the number of styles (generally one or two styles)</li>
  <li>are commonly used</li>
</ul>

<p>Premium fonts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>costly; prices vary</li>
  <li>typically better quality and elegantly designed</li>
  <li>have a complete character set</li>
  <li>usually have multiple styles</li>
  <li>exclusive and unique</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="font-resources">Font Resources</h4>

</blockquote>

<h2 id="color">Color</h2>

<h3 id="terminology-1">Terminology</h3>
<p><strong>Hue</strong> is what we think of when we think about color. It is the characteristic that makes a color unique.</p>

<p><img src="/llc-digital-skills/assets/img/week2/11-hue.jpg" class="print-50" /></p>

<p><strong>Saturation</strong> refers to how weak or strong the color is.</p>

<p><img src="/llc-digital-skills/assets/img/week2/12-saturation.jpg" class="print-50" /></p>

<p><strong>Value</strong> refers to the lightness or darkness of a color. Think about it as adding white (lightness) or black (darkness) to a color.</p>

<p><img src="/llc-digital-skills/assets/img/week2/13-value.jpg" class="print-50" /></p>

<h3 id="rgb-vs-cmyk">RGB vs CMYK</h3>

<h4 id="rgb">RGB</h4>

<ul>
  <li>stands for red, green, blue</li>
  <li>additive color system that is based on adding light</li>
  <li>used to specify colors for the web.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="cmyk">CMYK</h4>

<ul>
  <li>cyan, magenta, yellow and black</li>
  <li>subtractive color system that is based on ink printing</li>
  <li>used to specify colors for print.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/llc-digital-skills/assets/img/week2/14-rgb-cmyk.jpg" class="print-50" /></p>

<p>You can specify RGB colors on the web using the <code>rgb(#,#,#)</code> format in CSS (where # is a value between 0 and 255) or with the Hex color code such as <code>#FFFFFF</code>.</p>

<pre><code>p {
  color: #FFFFFF;
  /* or */
  color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="designing-with-color">Designing with Color</h3>

<p>A good design should work in the absence of color and should communicate clearly in black and white. But color is a valuable tool and can be used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to add meaning and evoke emotions</li>
  <li>to distinguish between different pieces of content</li>
  <li>to indicate the state of interactive elements</li>
  <li>add harmony and rhythm to your design</li>
</ul>

<p>Below are some items to consider when choosing colors.</p>

<h4 id="personality-and-meaning">Personality and Meaning</h4>
<p>Choose colors that reflect your personality or your brand. Consider the emotional responses of your target audience. Color communicates meaning. That meaning can vary across different cultures so it’s important to consider your target audience and how they perceive certain colors.</p>

<p>Also, think about how your audience will interact with your page. Use color to distinguish between elements and interactive states. For example, you might choose a default color for your navigation elements and a “selected” color.</p>

<p>Read more about color meaning and how to use color to enhance your designs <a href="http://vanseodesign.com/web-design/color-meaning/">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="harmony-and-rhythm-1">Harmony and Rhythm</h4>
<p>Color can be used to attract attention and organize content, creating a visual hierarchy. 
Repeating colors on elements adds clarity by allowing the viewer to make visual connections between pieces of content.</p>

<h4 id="less-is-more">Less is More</h4>
<p>Consider the number of colors to use in your design. Color helps to reinforce your message and guide people throughout your design. Choosing too many colors may confuse people. When in doubt use one primary color and a secondary accent color. Vary the saturation and value of your colors to add variety while maintaining clarity.</p>

<h3 id="color-accessibility">Color Accessibility</h3>
<p>It’s important to consider accessibility. Many people have some sort of visual color impairment such as being unable to distinguish certain colors from others. Remember that your design should work in the absence of color. Ensure sufficient contrast between colors to help people distinguish between different pieces of content. Use a variety of values and levels of saturation to add contrast.</p>

  <h2 id="exercise-choosing-colors">EXERCISE: Choosing colors</h2>
  <p>Choose up to 2 colors for your website and define how they will be used.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="brand-identity">Brand Identity</h2>

<p>Your website is a reflection of you and/or your business. Your website is is part of your brand.</p>

<p>Your <strong>brand</strong> is how you are perceived by your audience.<br />
Your <strong>logo</strong> is the visual expression of who you are to your audience.<br />
Your <strong>brand identity</strong> is a consistent set of artifacts that tell people who you are.</p>

<p>The fonts and colors you choose for your website becomes part of your brand identity. These can be carried through to the rest of your brand and serves as a foundation for your brand style guide.</p>

<p>A <strong>style guide</strong> defines the visual identity for you or your brand across <em>all</em> print and digital collateral.</p>

<h4 id="examples-of-brand-style-guides">Examples of brand style guides</h4>

  <li><a href="http://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/">Gov.uk web guidelines</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In web design, a <strong>style tile</strong> is used in much the same way as a style guide except that it defines styles that are specific to your website.</p>

<h4 id="examples-of-style-tiles">Examples of style tiles</h4>

<p><br />
Keep track of the different styles you use in a style guide or style tile. Use it as a reference as you build out your website and your brand collateral to maintain consistency and clarity.</p>
