General Tips

* may need to zoon in depending on project size. Wanted to style the notes for regular viewing on laptop for students - but not optimized for projectors
* blockquotes contain instructions for small to medium in-class exercises
* Chrome & Atom are used in all examples for consistency but let the students know they are free to explore but just note that things make look different or have slightly different features.
